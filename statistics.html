    <div class="question">
      Question 1: Are you aware of Electric Vehicles (EVs)
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question 1.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>Based on the given data, it can be interpreted that there is a moderate level of
        awareness regarding Electric Vehicles (EVs). Out of the 50 respondents, 28 indicated that they are aware of EVs,
        while 22 respondents stated that they are not aware. This suggests that a significant portion of the respondents
        has some knowledge or understanding of EVs, while a smaller portion is still unfamiliar with the concept. The
        results indicate a need for further education and awareness campaigns to bridge the knowledge gap and promote
        greater understanding of electric vehicles.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Question 2: Are you familiar with the benefits of electric vehicles compared to traditional vehicles?
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question2.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The results indicate a relatively balanced distribution between those familiar and
        unfamiliar with the benefits of electric vehicles compared to traditional vehicles. Out of 50 respondents, 52%
        answered affirmatively, suggesting that a majority have knowledge of the advantages EVs offer over conventional
        cars. On the other hand, 48% respondents admitted their lack of familiarity, indicating a significant portion of
        individuals who may require further information on the topic. It is noteworthy that there is a potential
        opportunity to educate and raise awareness about the benefits of electric vehicles among this group.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Question 3: Have you ever driven an electric vehicle?
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/question 3.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The data suggests that out of the total respondents, 60% individuals have
        experienced driving an electric vehicle, while 40% individuals have not. The ratio between those who have driven
        an electric vehicle and those who haven't is 3:2. This indicates a significant portion of the respondents have
        had first-hand experience with electric vehicles. It implies that a considerable number of people have been
        exposed to the driving characteristics, benefits, and challenges associated with electric vehicles, while there
        is still a substantial group that has yet to experience them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Question 4: Do you believe electric vehicles are a viable solution for reducing air pollution in India?
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question4.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The survey results indicate a mixed opinion on whether electric vehicles (EVs) are
        a viable solution for reducing air pollution in India. Of the 50 respondents, 58% (29 out of 50) believe that
        EVs are a viable solution, while 42% (21 out of 50) do not share the same belief. This suggests a significant
        number of people see EVs as a promising option for addressing air pollution concerns, while others may have
        reservations or alternative perspectives on the matter. Further discussion and analysis could provide deeper
        insights into the reasons behind these viewpoints.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Question 5: Are you concerned about the range limitations of electric vehicles?

    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question 5.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The question "Are you concerned about the range limitations of electric vehicles?"
        was posed to a group of individuals. Out of the total respondents, 54% indicated that they are concerned about
        the range limitations of electric vehicles, while 46% responded that they are not concerned. This suggests that
        a significant portion of the group acknowledges the current range limitations of electric vehicles as a
        potential issue, while a slightly smaller portion feels less worried about it. Further discussions and
        exploration of their perspectives can shed more light on their specific concerns or lack thereof.

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Question 6: Would the availability of government incentives or subsidies influence your decision to buy an
      electric vehicle?


    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question6.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The question "Would the availability of government incentives or subsidies
        influence your decision to buy an electric vehicle?" was posed, and 58 respondents answered in the affirmative,
        indicating that government incentives or subsidies would indeed impact their decision to purchase an electric
        vehicle. Conversely, 42 respondents answered in the negative, suggesting that government incentives or subsidies
        would not play a significant role in their decision-making process. This data highlights that a considerable
        portion of the surveyed population finds government incentives influential, while a smaller group remains
        unaffected by such factors.


      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Question 7: Would you be willing to pay a higher upfront cost for an electric vehicle compared to a traditional
      gasoline/diesel vehicle?
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question7.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The statement "Would you be willing to pay a higher upfront cost for an electric
        vehicle compared to a traditional gasoline/diesel vehicle?" explores individuals' willingness to invest more
        money initially in an electric vehicle over a conventional gasoline or diesel vehicle. Out of the surveyed
        respondents, 28 indicated their affirmative response, suggesting a willingness to bear the higher upfront cost.
        On the other hand, 22 respondents answered negatively, indicating their reluctance to pay a higher price for an
        electric vehicle. This data showcases a division in consumer attitudes towards upfront costs and their
        preference for electric or traditional vehicles.

    <div class="question">
      Question 8: Do you think the high cost of electric vehicles is a barrier to their adoption in India?

    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question8.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The question "Do you think the high cost of electric vehicles is a barrier to
        their adoption in India?" is seeking an opinion on whether the expensive price of electric vehicles hinders
        their widespread acceptance in the Indian market. The responses indicate that 27 individuals believe the high
        cost is indeed a barrier, while 23 individuals think otherwise. This demonstrates a somewhat divided
        perspective, with a slightly higher number of respondents recognizing the cost factor as a deterrent to the
        wider adoption of electric vehicles in India.

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Question 9: Are you aware of any government policies or initiatives to support electric vehicles

    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question9.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The question "Do you think the high cost of electric vehicles is a barrier to
        their adoption in India?" is seeking an opinion on whether the expensive price of electric vehicles hinders
        their widespread acceptance in the Indian market. The responses indicate that 27 individuals believe the high
        cost is indeed a barrier, while 23 individuals think otherwise. This demonstrates a somewhat divided

        wider adoption of electric vehicles in India.

    <div class="question">
      Question 10: Do you think the government should take additional measures to encourage the use of electric
      vehicles?

    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <img src="./assets/Question10.png">
      <p><span>Interpretation: </span>The question "Do you think the government should take additional measures to
        encourage the use of electric vehicles?" received 27 responses in favor (Yes) and 23 responses against (No).
        This indicates that there is a slightly higher percentage of individuals who believe the government should
        implement further initiatives to promote electric vehicle adoption. These additional measures may include
        incentives, subsidies, infrastructure development, and policy reforms. However, it is worth noting that a
        considerable number of respondents hold the opposite view, suggesting that there may be differing opinions on
        the necessity of additional government intervention in promoting electric vehicles.
