                    Welcome to our website! We are excited to share with you the findings of our recent survey on the
                    "Usage of
                    Electric Vehicles for Daily Mode of Transportation" in the Mansoor Nagar and Kottamitta areas of
                    Nellore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    we believe in the power of sustainable transportation and its potential to shape a cleaner and
                    greener
                    future. With this survey, we aimed to gain insights into the adoption and usage patterns of electric
                    vehicles (EVs) in these specific areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our survey was conducted over a span of 1 Month and surveyed over 50 participants from various
                    backgrounds and age groups. Through a combination of questionnaires and interviews, we sought to
                    understand
                    the factors influencing the decision to switch to electric vehicles, the overall experience of EV
                    owners,
                    and the challenges faced in the adoption process.

                We are a team of four members Phani, Jagannath, Kaif, and Hyder Ali. All of us are
                currently studying in the second year of our program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
                (AIML). As a team, we have collaborated closely on the project, pooling our individual skills,
                knowledge, and perspectives to ensure its success. Together, we have demonstrated a strong commitment to
                our studies and a shared passion for AIML. Our collective efforts and teamwork have played a crucial
                role in driving the project forward, and we are proud of the work we have accomplished together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout our journey as a team, we have fostered a collaborative and supportive environment, where
                open communication and idea sharing thrive. Each team member brings unique strengths and expertise to
                the table, enriching our collective knowledge and allowing us to tackle challenges from different
                angles. We have learned to leverage our individual skills in programming, data analysis, research, and
                problem-solving to contribute effectively to the project. Our dedication and synergy have not only
                enabled us to overcome obstacles but have also fostered a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose. As we
                continue to progress in our AIML program, we are excited to explore more projects together, deepen our
                understanding of this dynamic field, and make a positive impact in the world of artificial intelligence
                and machine learning.
